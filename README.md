## Introduction
Hey! My name is idibo and i hope your having a great day. I am a student who has intrests in 
basketball, gaming, music, bowling, sports in general, and i love swimming.

  Usually when i get my free time i spend a lot of time in my room either watching some movies or netflix, i love going to the park to go play 
pick up with some random people there. I like meeting new people because it creates more oppurtunities for me to see what they like and if 
they have similar interests as me. Im mostly intrested in the gaming series "Doom". Doom is basically a center around a lone space marine, 
often called the Doom Slayer, battling demonic forces that have invaded various locations, including Mars, Earth, and other dimensions. So 
yeah pretty fun and awesome game to play i definitely would reccomend this game to people who are intrested in story modes. 

  If you didn't know my favorite sport is basketball, I started in 5th grade, I didn't take basketball seriously at this time because i just  
saw it as a fun game to play with friends and family. 6th grade came along and i started taking the agme more seriously because i had and still 
have passion for it, 6th grade was my starting point. Anyways i progressed and progressed and now i am somewhat decent at the game i love the most. 
I see basketball kinda like a comfort food, yknow? Even though im not the best at it who cares? Theres more to life than basketball... i think.

One of the most favorite memories of my summer was going camping with my friends down in campland san diego. That place was the life, We'd get up brush our teeth then go to the cantina and order some breakfast burritos for our appetite, and then we'd go down to the bay or the jacuzzi for the rest of the day to just talk and chill. As i said i love basketball so of course i brought my ball with me. We went down to the courts and played some pick up. It was a great time to meet new people and spend time with my friends.
